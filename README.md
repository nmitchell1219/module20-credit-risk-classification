# Supervised Learning Challenge

This challenge focuses on building a logistic regression model to evaluate loan risk using historical data from a peer-to-peer lending company. The task involves preprocessing the data, training the model, and assessing its performance with metrics like confusion matrices and classification reports. The goal is to determine the model's ability to predict the creditworthiness of borrowers. This project encapsulates the application of machine learning techniques in finance, emphasizing model evaluation and documentation.
